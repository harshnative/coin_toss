# coin_toss
this simple program helps you truly randomize the toss result with up to 100 times of degree of randomness

you can find the direct executable file under the releases section of github 
you can donwload and use the exe file , it is 100% virus free don't worry , you can change the icon and place it on destop so it looks nice 
exe file provided is directly executable , thier is no need for the further installation 

if the exe file is not runnning then follow the following steps

1. download the dev c++ form the following link { https://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html }
2. install the software
3. open the software and press ctrl + n
4. copy the source code or just double click on the sourcecode.cpp and click compile
5. save the file and the exe file will open and you can use the exe file directly which is located where you have saved the file initially

"you can make changes and add feature accordingly or if you are not a developer , then you can contect me , hopefully i can help you"

this machine works on he principle of absolute randomness as nothing is random even when you use random function in language , thier is always some preset of algorithms running which defines the final output but this software generates a random numbers based on current time which can never be same 
so you will enjoy absolute randomness 

you can extent the degree of randomness from 1 to 100 by putting the number in the input when asked 

the animation is reduced as soon as you increase the extent of randomness above 10 as it will save your time :)
